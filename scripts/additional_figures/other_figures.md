## Moody plot

The Moody plot shows the relation between the Reynolds number and the friction factor.
Between AM15 on 9 August and AM13 on 21 August the friction factor does not change even though the Reynolds numbers are considerably different.

## Thermodynamic variables

These plots are based on the same data as Figure 5 in the paper but instead of daily averages the values for the individual tracer experiments are shown.
