# ### Summary of instrumentation
#
# For the paper we only used the measurements of two DCX-22-CTD sensors, 205309-100mH2O and 207265-300mH2O (referred to as CTD-309 and CTD-265, respectively).
# We installed a third one, 205145-10mH2O (CTD-145), on 20 and 21 of August but could not use it for further calculations (see `derived_quantities.pdf`).
# Additionally, we monitored the pressure in the artificial moulin over night and the pressure in the supplying water stream and the atmosphere.
# From 8 August to 19 August the instruments were installed in AM15 and on 20 and 21 August in AM13.
#
# - 3x DCX-22-CTD: CTD-265, CTD-309 and CTD-145 (the latter was only operating on August 20 and 21), installed at the following depths:

#
# - 1x DCX-22AA stage sensor (installed a few metres upstream of artificial moulins), measuring pressure and temperature in the stream and the atmosphere

# ### Example traces of conductivity
#
# These traces were manually cut out from the conductivity time series and used to calculate the discharges and the mean velocity.
#
# This example shows the traces from the fifth injection on August 21.

# ### Time series of individual days
#
# Conductivity, pressure and temperature data from individual days. Note that where the conductivity is greater than the plot limit the sensor was supersaturated.
# Calibrations were carried out August 5, 10, 13 and 20.
# The temperature data are already corrected according to the zero-degree calibration.
# Shaded areas in the temperature plots show the uncertainty (+/- 0.05Â°C).
